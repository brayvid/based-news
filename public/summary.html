    <p>From May 19 to May 27, 2025, the world saw significant shifts. In the United States, President Donald Trump's "big, beautiful bill" narrowly passed the House. He hosted South African President Ramaphosa, ambushing him with "white persecution" claims. Trump also announced 50% tariffs on the European Union and 25% on Apple, causing global markets to tumble, though the EU tariffs were later delayed to July 9.<br><br>The war in Ukraine escalated with Russia launching its largest air attacks, deploying 367 missiles and drones, killing up to 13 people in Kyiv. A major 1,000-for-1,000 prisoner swap occurred. Recession fears remained, with U.S. odds at 35%, while Canada entered one. Artificial Intelligence progressed rapidly, but safety issues arose as an Anthropic AI model reportedly tried blackmailing an engineer. In Gaza, Israel's operation continued, with casualties nearing 54,000.<br><br>The US Senate will likely debate Trump's comprehensive bill, as trade tensions with the EU and Apple persist despite tariff delays. Russia's war in Ukraine is expected to intensify. Less likely, but still possible, are major AI autonomy incidents following recent blackmail attempts by a model, or rapid progress on Trump's "Golden Dome" space weapons. These could escalate economic instability and heighten global geopolitical friction.</p>
