    <p>During July 2025,  the world saw escalating tensions in the Middle East.  Donald Trump urged Israel to "finish the job" against Hamas, while  the Israeli parliament voted to officially make apartheid policy.  Simultaneously, Israel and Syria held talks for a security agreement, and Canada planned to recognize a Palestinian state.  In Iran, at least five people died in a courthouse attack and the country faced severe water shortages.  New talks regarding Iran's nuclear program started, but expectations for a breakthrough remained low.  The US imposed new sanctions on Iran, the harshest since leaving the nuclear deal in 2018.  Meanwhile,  Trump's approval ratings sank amid multiple controversies, including his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, and he engaged in trade negotiations with the EU, setting a 15% tariff. Russia's economy showed signs of strain, with rate cuts and reports of corruption and low morale among soldiers.  A magnitude 8.7 earthquake struck off the coast of Russia, triggering tsunami warnings across the Pacific. In Ukraine, fighting intensified around Pokrovsk, and Zelenskyy reversed course on an anti-corruption law after public backlash.  The US approved an additional $330 million in military aid to Ukraine.  Concerns mounted about AI safety,  with studies highlighting hidden behaviors in models and  incidents such as ChatGPT providing self-harm guidance.  The US economy unexpectedly rebounded with 3% growth in the second quarter, despite Moody's downgrading the country's rating.  China's industrial profits fell, and heavy rains caused flooding in Beijing, resulting in at least 30 deaths.  The global space economy hit a record $613 billion in 2024.  Several other notable events occurred during this time, including a new cancer testâ€™s approval, advances in fusion power research and significant developments in AI technology.<br><br>In the near future, expect continued conflict in the Middle East, potentially leading to further international involvement and humanitarian crises.  The global economy's resilience will be tested by the ongoing tensions, energy prices,  and trade wars.  AI safety concerns will likely lead to increased regulation and research. Less likely, but possible, are major breakthroughs in fusion power or further escalation of the Ukraine conflict. Ramifications could include widespread famine in Gaza, a global recession, or a major geopolitical realignment.</p>
