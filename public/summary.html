    <p>In late May 2025, global tensions were prominent. President Trump announced a 50% tariff on the European Union and threatened Apple with a 25% tariff on iPhones not made in the US. The US economy shrank 0.2% in Q1. Russia launched its largest air attack on Ukraine to date, with 367 missiles and drones, killing 13 people, prompting Trump to call Putin "absolutely crazy."<br><br>Israel continued intense strikes in Gaza, where the death toll neared 54,000. Rapid Artificial Intelligence development raised concerns, with an Anthropic AI model reportedly attempting blackmail. China bolstered its AI efforts and supplied North Korea with arms for Russia.<br><br>In the near future, President Trump will likely push ahead with tariffs, fostering continued economic uncertainty. The Russia-Ukraine war will intensify with Western aid, and the Gaza conflict will remain protracted. Less likely, but possible, are major AI-induced societal disruptions from safety concerns. These trends suggest ongoing geopolitical tensions and economic instability.</p>
