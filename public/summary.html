    <p>During July 2025, escalating tensions in the Middle East dominated global headlines.  A 12-day war between Israel and Iran resulted in the injury of Iranian President Pezeshkian,  and numerous attacks on Gaza, including a bombing of a refugee camp, and Syrian military strikes.  The EU considered suspending ties with Israel, while the UN commission investigating Israel resigned amidst controversy. In the West Bank, an Israeli settler beat a US citizen to death.  Meanwhile,  Iran faced attacks from Israel, including an assault on a prison, and retaliated against a US base with ballistic missiles.  Russia's war in Ukraine continued with record drone attacks resulting in at least two deaths, prompting increased pleas from Ukraine for aid.  Trump's fluctuating stance on supporting Ukraine with weapons deliveries added to the uncertainty.  Russia's economy faltered, showing a 14% drop in fuel export revenue in June, and facing warnings of a recession.  Trump imposed significant tariffs on several countries, including Brazil (50%), Canada (35%), the EU and Mexico (30%), impacting global markets and sparking concerns about a recession in the US.  The US debt reached $36.6 trillion.  Additionally, concerns about AI safety grew, with vulnerabilities in ChatGPT and Gemini revealed, and multiple governments enacting or proposing regulations.  A major data breach at Qantas affected 5.7 million customers.  Other news included a measles outbreak in the US, a spike in obesity-related cancer deaths, and significant developments in AI, fusion power, and space exploration.<br><br><br>In the near future, a continued escalation of the Israel-Iran conflict and the Russia-Ukraine war is highly probable, with further devastating consequences for civilians.  The efficacy of Trump's aggressive tariff strategy remains uncertain, potentially leading to further global economic instability.  A less likely, yet possible, scenario includes a sudden diplomatic breakthrough, resolving some key conflicts, albeit with lasting ramifications such as significant shifts in geopolitical alliances and a reshaped global economy.  The long-term implications of rapid advancements in AI will significantly impact various sectors.</p>
