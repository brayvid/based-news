    <p>During the first week of July 2025, global events were marked by escalating conflict and domestic policy changes. The Israel-Iran war saw Iranian military elite eliminated and Israeli bases struck. In Gaza, Israeli attacks killed over 600 Palestinians, while 5 Israeli soldiers died. Ceasefire talks with Hamas continue. U.S. President Donald Trump signed his "One Big Beautiful Bill," allocating $150 billion to military funding but cutting Medicaid and climate research. Trump also intensified trade wars with tariffs up to 70% on various countries. Extreme weather included floods killing 78 in Texas and deadly European heatwaves.<br><br>The Gaza conflict will likely escalate further despite ceasefire talks, worsening the humanitarian crisis. Trump's tariffs will intensify global trade wars, straining economies. Climate change will continue bringing extreme weather. Less likely, but possible, a wider Middle East war or significant U.S. economic recession could unfold, with ramifications including heightened instability and widespread suffering.</p>
