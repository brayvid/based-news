    <p>From July 10th to July 18th, 2025, global events were dominated by escalating conflicts and political turmoil.  A 12-day war between Israel and Iran resulted in an Israeli airstrike injuring Iranian President Pezeshkian, prompting retaliatory attacks and accusations of assassination attempts.  Israel also conducted numerous strikes in Syria, targeting military headquarters and responding to clashes between Druze and Bedouin clans.  Simultaneously,  Israeli settlers committed violence against Palestinians, including the death of a U.S. citizen.  Israel blocked medical equipment from entering Gaza, citing potential Hamas use.  The United Nations commission investigating Israel resigned amid a Trump crackdown.  In Texas, floods caused by extreme weather killed 120 people, leaving 160 missing, prompting a visit from Donald Trump.  Trump also initiated a series of actions, including threatening tariffs against Russia and Canada if they didn't reach a ceasefire in Ukraine within 50 days,  and revoking the US citizenship of Rosie O’Donnell.  A Senate report found that the Secret Service did not act on direct threats before a shooting attempt against Trump.  Russia's economy faced recession fears, and the country’s fuel export revenue fell 14% in June.  Concerns over AI safety grew, with OpenAI delaying the launch of its open-weight AI model, and several top AI firms issuing warnings about the potential dangers of advanced AI.  The EU unveiled a voluntary AI code of practice.  In the financial markets, Trump's tariff threats caused volatility, with Bitcoin surging while stocks and bonds slid.  China's economy grew despite deflationary pressures and looming tariffs, while a Wells Fargo banker was blocked from leaving China.  The US passed the GENIUS Act, its first major national cryptocurrency legislation.  A magnitude 7.3 earthquake struck Alaska, triggering a tsunami advisory.  Meanwhile, a North Korean defector filed lawsuits against Kim Jong-un.  Measles cases surged globally, and the death of Julian McMahon from cancer was announced.<br><br>In the near future, further escalation of the Israel-Iran conflict is highly likely, potentially drawing in other regional actors.  A wider war is possible but less likely. The ramifications could include significant humanitarian crises, further regional instability, and global economic repercussions.  Trump's unpredictable actions will likely continue to destabilize global markets and international relations.  The AI safety debate will intensify, alongside the rapid advancement of AI technologies.  The situation in Ukraine remains highly volatile, dependent largely upon Trump's continued engagement and unpredictable policies.</p>
