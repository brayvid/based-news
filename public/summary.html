Israel and Iran engaged in open warfare, with Israel striking Iranian nuclear and energy facilities. Iran retaliated with missile attacks on Israeli cities like Haifa and Beersheba, injuring over 200 and hitting a hospital. Israel also killed Iran's wartime chief of staff.<br><br>US President Donald Trump authorized American B-2 bomber strikes that "obliterated" three Iranian nuclear sites, causing oil prices to rise. Concurrently, Russia's war in Ukraine continued with deadly missile and drone attacks on Kyiv, killing at least 30. North Korea is sending 5,000 workers to Russia. Separately, the US Federal Reserve maintained interest rates, and a global data breach exposed 16 billion login credentials, alongside rising AI safety concerns.<br><br>Iran will likely retaliate, possibly closing the Strait of Hormuz, causing oil prices to surge and deepening recession fears.
