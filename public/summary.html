Iran retaliated, killing 8 people with missiles in Tel Aviv and Haifa. Israel also killed 38 Palestinians near Gaza aid sites. U.S. President Trump urged Tehran residents to evacuate and deployed defensive forces. Meanwhile, Russia launched deadly drone and missile attacks on Kyiv, killing at least 14, while Ukraine struck a Russian drone factory. Economically, oil prices rose, and U.S. retail sales declined.
