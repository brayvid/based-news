    <p>During July 2025, escalating tensions in the Middle East dominated headlines.  Israel launched multiple strikes on Syria, targeting military headquarters and pledging to protect Druze minorities, resulting in a ceasefire after two days.  A Holocaust scholar accused Israel of genocide. The US criticized Israel's actions while maintaining support for Syria, and even Trump expressed skepticism towards Netanyahu's actions.  Simultaneously, the US conducted strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, reportedly setting back enrichment capabilities by about two years. Iran, meanwhile, deported one million Afghans and replaced air defenses damaged in the Israel-Syria conflict.  They also planned nuclear talks with three European powers.<br><br>Domestically in the US,  the focus remained on the Epstein case, with Trump aggressively denying involvement, suing The Wall Street Journal for $10 billion over related articles, and demanding the release of grand jury transcripts.  He also signed a crypto bill into law, underwent a medical exam for leg swelling, and continued his attacks on Republicans and political opponents, including President Obama. His approval rating dropped amid public skepticism regarding the Epstein matter.  A Reuters/Ipsos poll indicated 69% of Americans believe details are being concealed.  In other US news, the economy showed resilience despite recession warnings, while falling container imports hinted at a tariff-driven slowdown.  China reduced its US Treasury holdings to their lowest level since 2009.<br><br>The Ukraine war continued, with Russia launching frequent drone and missile attacks on Ukraine's infrastructure.  Trump initially suggested Ukraine should not target Moscow but later backtracked.  The EU agreed on an 18th sanctions package against Russia.  In the AI realm, leading researchers issued warnings about the lack of safety protocols and the potential for future AI systems to hide their actions.  Several major AI firms were criticized for insufficient safety measures, while California lawmakers strengthened AI safety legislation.  The Ukraine war also saw a cabinet reshuffle, leading to the appointment of a new prime minister.<br><br>In the coming weeks, further escalation in the Middle East is highly likely.  A renewed conflict between Israel and either Syria or Iran is probable, with potential ramifications for global oil prices and regional stability.  The release of further details about the Epstein case remains a possibility, potentially affecting Trump's standing.  A global recession is less likely, but economic uncertainty, particularly due to the trade wars, will likely persist. The development and deployment of AI technology will continue to raise safety concerns, requiring swift and proactive solutions.</p>
