    <p>From August 13th to August 20th, 2025, global events unfolded rapidly.  In Israel, settlement expansion plans, criticized for potentially dividing the West Bank, were announced amidst record-high settler attacks in the West Bank.  Simultaneously, Israel's economy shrank, partly due to the war effort against Iran.  Tensions escalated between Israel and its Western allies, particularly Australia,  over potential Palestinian statehood recognition. Iran faced internal protests and an energy crisis, while issuing new war warnings.  A bus crash involving deported Afghans resulted in at least 79 deaths.<br><br>In the United States, Donald Trump engaged in extensive political activity.  This included a high-stakes meeting with Vladimir Putin,  resulting in no announced ceasefire in Ukraine despite claims of "great progress".  Trump also made significant financial investments, announced plans to target mail-in ballots and "woke" museums,  and faced a lawsuit over his attempt to seize control of DC Metro Police.  His approval ratings plummeted.  Meanwhile,  the US economy showed mixed signals, with rising wholesale prices and corporate bankruptcies.   <br><br>Discussions regarding AI safety dominated headlines, with key personnel departures from prominent AI companies and concerns over AI's self-preservation tactics, misuse with children, and potential for harm to humanity. A class-action lawsuit was filed against Otter AI for secret recording.  The Federal Reserve ended a special crypto oversight program.  The Ukraine conflict continued,  with Russia bombarding Ukrainian cities and a high-profile meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy.

Concerns of a global recession intensified.<br><br><br>In the near future, a major escalation in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is highly likely, possibly including a full-scale invasion of Gaza City. A global recession is possible, fueled by geopolitical instability and economic uncertainty.  Less likely, but possible, is a major breakthrough in AI safety regulations or a significant escalation of the conflict between the US and China or Russia. The ramifications could include widespread famine, refugee crises, and potentially significant global economic disruption, possibly even a broader conflict.</p>
