    <p>The period from late June to early July 2025 witnessed intense global activity. Israel concluded a 12-day war with Iran, yet continued strikes on Gaza, resulting in hundreds of Palestinian deaths, including 71 at Evin Prison. President Trump signed a $4.5 trillion tax-cut and spending bill, adding $3.3 trillion to the national debt and boosting the Pentagon by $150 billion. This spurred Elon Musk to form the "America Party." The US added 147,000 jobs in June, though trade tariffs loom large.<br><br>Meanwhile, Russia claimed Luhansk in Ukraine, launching 5,438 drones in June, as the US halted some arms. North Korea is sending 30,000 troops to Russia. AI made strides, with Microsoft’s AI diagnosing better than doctors, but also led to 9,000 Microsoft layoffs and safety worries. Climate change manifested in Texas floods killing 78 and lethal European heat.<br><br>Gaza ceasefire talks will remain difficult despite Trump’s involvement, with ongoing Israeli pressure. Trump’s August 1st tariffs are highly likely, escalating trade wars with Japan, South Korea, and BRICS nations, risking a global economic downturn. Less likely, but still entirely possible, is further societal disruption from rapid AI advancement and escalating conflicts, especially in Ukraine, alongside deepening humanitarian crises.</p>
