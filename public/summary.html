    <p>From June 16-23, 2025, global tensions dramatically escalated. Israel and Iran engaged in fierce missile exchanges, hitting cities like Tel Aviv, Tehran, and Haifa. Israel attacked Iranian nuclear facilities, prompting US intervention as President Trump declared multiple Iranian nuclear sites "obliterated." Iran retaliated, striking an Israeli hospital in Beersheba, wounding over 200. Concurrently, Russia launched deadly drone and missile attacks on Kyiv, causing significant casualties. North Korea pledged 5,000 workers to Russia. The Federal Reserve held interest rates steady, but oil prices surged and Bitcoin fell below $100,000 due to the US strikes. AI safety laws advanced in New York amidst OpenAI's warnings of bioweapon risks, while climate change indicators hit new highs.<br><br>Likely, US military action in Iran will continue, aiming for "regime change," with Iran probably closing the Strait of Hormuz, triggering oil price shocks and deepening recession fears. Cyberattacks on US targets will intensify. Less likely but possible: direct Russian/Chinese military aid to Iran, widening conflict globally. Ramifications include protracted regional war, severe economic turmoil, and diversion from other global crises.</p>
