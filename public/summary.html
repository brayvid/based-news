    <p>From June 15-16, 2025, a four-day conflict escalated between Israel and Iran. Israeli strikes hit Iran's energy and three nuclear facilities, including a 2.5 magnitude blast reported near Fordow. Iran retaliated with missiles, killing 8 people in Israel and striking Haifa. In Gaza, Israeli actions killed 38 Palestinians. US President Trump, at the G7 summit, rejected an Israeli plan to assassinate Iranâ€™s Supreme Leader and urged de-escalation. Oil prices initially surged over 3%, but markets largely focused on the Federal Reserve maintaining interest rates, rather than the conflict. Separately, New York State passed the RAISE Act, establishing AI safety safeguards to prevent "catastrophic risks."<br><br>Likely, Israel and Iran will continue fighting for weeks, but a "battered" Iran will seek negotiations. Less likely, a full regional war could erupt if diplomacy fails or Iran withdraws from its nuclear treaty, risking instability and energy volatility. US President Trump will likely focus on domestic policies and tariffs.</p>
