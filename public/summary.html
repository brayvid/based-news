    <p>From August 22nd to 29th, 2025, global events were dominated by escalating tensions in the Middle East.  Israel launched an offensive into Gaza City, resulting in over 63,000 Palestinian deaths and a declared famine, with 322 deaths attributed to starvation.  The Dutch foreign minister resigned over sanctions disagreements concerning Israel.  Meanwhile, Israel conducted raids in Syria and Lebanon, leading to casualties in Lebanon and international condemnation.  The US Democratic National Committee (DNC) rejected a call for an arms ban to Israel.  In Iran, Israel launched a deadly strike on Evin prison, prompting European states to reimpose UN sanctions and Germany to urge its citizens to leave Iran.  Australia expelled Iran's envoy following antisemitic attacks.  Thirteen militants were killed in southeast Iran.  <br><br>Donald Trump's actions were a major focus, including threats of martial law, proposed crackdowns on several US cities, and a controversial plan to send the National Guard to Chicago. He fired a general over an intelligence assessment of Iranian strikes and cancelled Kamala Harris’s Secret Service detail.  Trump's administration faced criticism for its subdued response to Russia’s assault on Kyiv and its plans to expand crime and immigration crackdowns.  In Russia,  ExxonMobil held talks about returning to Russia.  Trump continued to weigh sanctions against Russia.  Russia requested a UN Security Council meeting over Nord Stream blasts.  In the AI sphere, concerns over safety grew after a lawsuit against OpenAI and a report of Instagram's chatbot aiding suicidal plans.  OpenAI and Anthropic conducted joint safety tests.  Several governments expressed concern over AI safety.  Financial markets saw record highs despite concerns over Nvidia's earnings and trade tariffs.  The US economy grew at a revised 3.3% rate in the second quarter.  Ukraine continued its counteroffensive against Russia, targeting energy facilities and oil refineries.  China experienced economic anxieties, including the delisting of Evergrande and a major purge of military leaders.   A typhoon prompted evacuations in Vietnam and China.  The ongoing Ukraine war saw Russia launch several air assaults on Kyiv resulting in civilian deaths and damage to an EU building, and Trump approving the sale of 3,350 extended-range missiles to Ukraine.  Climate change continued to cause catastrophic events, including wildfires and heatwaves.  <br><br><br>In the near future, expect increased international pressure on Israel to cease its Gaza offensive.  A potential negotiated settlement involving hostage releases is likely, though the outcome and ramifications, especially on long-term regional stability, are uncertain.  Less likely, but possible, is a wider regional conflict involving Iran and other actors.  This could have devastating consequences globally. The ongoing AI safety concerns will likely lead to tighter regulation.  The global economic situation and the outcome of the US-China trade war will greatly impact market dynamics.</p>
