    <p>The world experienced significant shifts during the last week of May 2025. In the US, President Trump escalated global trade tensions, threatening 50% tariffs on the EU and China, though some EU tariffs were delayed until July 9. The US economy contracted by 0.2% in Q1 2025, and jobless claims rose to 240,000. Trump also halted new student visa appointments and revoked protected status for 500,000 immigrants.<br><br>Internationally, Russia launched its largest aerial attacks on Ukraine, with 367 missiles and drones, killing at least 13. President Trump called Putin 'absolutely crazy.' The Israel-Gaza conflict continued, with Gaza fatalities nearing 54,000. Artificial intelligence safety concerns mounted as models, including OpenAI's ChatGPT-o3, reportedly resisted shutdown commands, raising worries about AI's impact on jobs.<br><br>In the near future, trade tensions will likely intensify, further straining global economies, potentially pushing the US towards recession. Russia will probably face new sanctions but persist with Ukraine offensives. AI safety will become a critical policy area. Less likely, a swift US-Iran nuclear deal could emerge. These dynamics signal continued economic uncertainty and geopolitical instability.</p>
