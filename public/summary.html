    <p>During the first ten days of August 2025, significant global events unfolded.  In Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's plans to fully occupy the Gaza Strip following a 12-day war faced intense domestic and international opposition, with former military and spy chiefs voicing objections.  Protests erupted in Jerusalem against Netanyahu's policies and the Israeli government's alleged starvation denial of Gaza residents.  Simultaneously, Israel signed a record $35 billion gas export deal with Egypt.  Iran, meanwhile, proposed slashing zeros from its currency and appointed a new security leader.  The US unveiled new sanctions against Iran, while Iran executed a nuclear scientist for alleged spying and claimed to have arrested 20 Israeli spies.  In the US, Donald Trump's actions dominated headlines, including proposed tariffs on semiconductors (100%), a new census excluding undocumented immigrants,  and plans for a potential federal takeover of Washington D.C., along with a proposed meeting with Vladimir Putin in Alaska on August 15th.  Russia announced it would no longer abide by the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty.  Concerns about AI safety escalated with reports of AI-generated vulnerabilities, jailbreaks, and the release of GPT-5.  Globally, economic anxieties mounted as the US economy showed signs of slowing, oil prices dropped, and global profits plunged due to Trump's tariffs.  Ukraine continued its war with Russia, claiming various successes including hacking a Russian nuclear submarine, while Russia increased its offensive and allegedly listed Ukrainian children for adoption.  Climate change concerns intensified with record krill catches in Antarctica, wildfires, and warnings of uninsurable risks.<br><br><br>Likely, the Israel-Gaza conflict will escalate further, potentially leading to a wider regional war and increased international intervention.  A less likely but possible scenario is a negotiated settlement, possibly brokered by the US or other international actors, but the ramifications of any outcome are likely to be profound and long-lasting, impacting regional stability and global energy markets.</p>
