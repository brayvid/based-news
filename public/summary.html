    <p>Between June 15 and 19, 2025, the Middle East plunged into deeper conflict. Israel and Iran exchanged missile strikes for four days; Israel hit Iranian nuclear and energy sites, while Iran struck Israeli cities like Haifa and Beersheba, injuring over 200. Tragically, 38 Palestinians were also killed during Gaza aid operations. U.S. President Trump demanded Iran’s "unconditional surrender" and weighed U.S. military action, leading to a jump in oil prices.<br><br>Domestically, the Federal Reserve kept interest rates steady, defying Trump, amid rising recession fears. Trump’s administration also expanded deportations and imposed new tariffs. Elsewhere, Russian missile strikes killed at least 14 in Kyiv. China's nuclear arsenal grew by 100 warheads, while AI safety gained legislative focus in New York, though concerns about job displacement and bioweapons risks persist.<br><br>In the near future, U.S. military intervention in the escalating Israel-Iran conflict is highly likely, potentially triggering wider regional war and significant oil price surges. Less likely but possible, Iran might exit the nuclear treaty, pushing the world closer to nuclear instability as Russia warned. This would cause global economic and geopolitical upheaval, alongside accelerating AI's dual-use dilemma.</p>
