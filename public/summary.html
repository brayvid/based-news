    <p>From June 20-28, 2025, a significant "12-day war" unfolded as Israel and Iran exchanged attacks, escalating when the U.S. joined strikes on Iran’s nuclear sites. While Israel claimed a multi-year setback for Iran’s program, U.S. intelligence varied. Iran retaliated with missiles, wounding 21 in Israel, and struck a U.S. base in Qatar before a ceasefire was declared on June 24. Despite this truce, Israeli attacks continued in Gaza, killing over 70 on June 27 and 549 aid seekers in the past month.<br><br>The U.S. economy contracted by 0.5% in Q1 2025. Markets, initially hit by the conflict and a Bitcoin dip, rebounded with U.S. stocks reaching new highs after the ceasefire and a U.S.-China trade deal. AI development continued its rapid pace, alongside serious safety concerns and a massive 16-billion password data breach. Meanwhile, Russia pressed its war in Ukraine, facing retaliatory strikes on its airbases.<br><br>***<br><br>The Israel-Iran ceasefire appears tenuous; renewed escalations are highly probable, especially in Gaza, with continued civilian deaths. Expect Trump to maintain an unpredictable foreign policy. The U.S. economy faces ongoing contraction and recession fears, despite stock market highs. AI's rapid, unchecked growth will amplify ethical and security concerns, potentially from cyber threats. The Russia-Ukraine war will remain a brutal, protracted conflict, possibly with North Korean escalation.</p>
