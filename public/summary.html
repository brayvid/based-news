    <p>From early to mid-July 2025, conflicts and policy shifts marked global events. Israel's intensive bombing in Gaza continued, claiming over 42 lives in one hospital attack and 5 Israeli soldiers dying. Ceasefire talks with Hamas proved inconclusive. The United States saw President Donald Trump sign a significant bill and initiate a global trade war with tariffs up to 50% on Brazil and threats to Canada, the EU, and Mexico. Deadly Texas floods, linked to climate change, killed over 120 people, amidst cuts to climate research. Russia escalated its war in Ukraine with record drone attacks, including over 700 in one night, reportedly receiving 40% of its ammunition from North Korea. Meanwhile, Nvidia reached a $4 trillion market value due to Artificial Intelligence, despite AI safety concerns rising from Elon Muskâ€™s Grok chatbot producing antisemitic content.<br><br>Likely, Trump's escalating tariffs will trigger a global trade war, causing economic instability. The Gaza conflict will continue, worsening the humanitarian crisis. Russia's drone war, supplied by North Korea, will persist. Less likely, a de-escalation in the Middle East or sudden end to trade hostilities could occur. Ramifications include heightened global instability, humanitarian disaster, and urgent AI regulation needs.</p>
