Israeli military actions in Gaza led to over 58,000 Palestinian deaths, and an Israeli airstrike reportedly injured Iranâ€™s President Pezeshkian, escalating their conflict. Russia launched record drone attacks on Ukraine, including 728 in one night, bolstered by North Korea supplying over 12 million artillery shells.<br><br>U.S. President Trump broadened trade wars, imposing tariffs up to 50% on several nations. He also issued a 50-day ultimatum to Russia for a Ukraine peace deal, threatening 100% tariffs otherwise. Economically, Bitcoin surged past $120,000, and Nvidia became the first company to reach a $4 trillion market value. Climate change impacts were stark, with Texas floods causing 120 deaths and a European heatwave tripling fatalities.<br><br>Expect escalating Israeli-Iranian conflict and deepening Gaza crisis.
