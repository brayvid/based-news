    <p>Over the past four days, from June 15 to June 18, 2025, the Middle East conflict intensified significantly. Israel launched strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities and state media, killing Iran's wartime chief of staff. Iran responded with missile attacks on Israeli cities like Haifa and Tel Aviv, killing 8 people. US President Trump demanded Iran's "unconditional surrender" and urged Tehran residents to evacuate, hinting at potential US military involvement. Meanwhile, Russia's war in Ukraine saw deadly missile and drone strikes on Kyiv, killing at least 15. Oil prices surged globally, and the US Federal Reserve maintained interest rates. In AI, New York passed a safety act, yet concerns grew over AI's military use and job displacement, with Amazon's CEO predicting corporate job cuts.<br><br>US military intervention in the Israel-Iran conflict is highly likely, triggering Iranian retaliation against US bases and cyberattacks. This risks major regional instability and higher oil prices. Less likely is a swift settlement or US congressional restraint on Trump, which otherwise risks a deeper Mideast conflict with broader geopolitical involvement.</p>
