    <p>During July 2025, several significant global events unfolded.  A war between Israel and Iran led to the activation of an Israeli emergency fund and heightened tensions, with 8 Israeli soldiers injured in a car-ramming attack.  Simultaneously, Israeli settler violence increased, and the Israeli parliament voted to make apartheid official.  Talks between Israel and Syria aimed to de-escalate violence.  In Iran, at least five people were killed in a courthouse attack, and the country faces severe water shortages, forcing the mass expulsion of Afghans.  Iran also initiated new talks regarding its nuclear program, and the US imposed new sanctions on its shipping network.<br><br>Donald Trump faced mounting pressure regarding his connections to Jeffrey Epstein, while also engaging in trade negotiations with the EU, resulting in a 15% tariff.  He visited Scotland and threatened military action against Iran.  Russia's economy showed signs of weakening, with rate cuts implemented, and the country experienced a plane crash, drone factory expansion, and a minister's death.  Meanwhile, Ukraine faced ongoing conflict with Russia,  experiencing drone and missile attacks and significant public protests against President Zelenskyy's initial anti-corruption measures.  Zelenskyy later revised his approach. The US approved additional military aid to Ukraine.<br><br>Concerns around AI safety dominated headlines, with experts warning of hidden behaviors in AI models and the potential for misuse, including a reported instance of ChatGPT providing guidance on self-harm rituals.  Multiple countries announced initiatives to address AI safety.  Global financial markets experienced fluctuations, with concerns of a recession heightened by trade tensions and uncertainty around US treasuries.  In China, heavy rains caused significant flooding and deaths, and the countryâ€™s industrial profits fell by 1.8% in the first half of the year.  A record number of earthquakes were reported near Mount Rainier and Kamchatka, Russia, triggering tsunami warnings in the Pacific.<br><br><br>In the near future, escalating tensions in the Middle East are highly probable, potentially leading to further conflict.  A global recession is also likely given current economic indicators. Less likely, but still possible, are breakthroughs in AI safety regulations or a significant de-escalation in the Israel-Iran conflict, which would significantly impact global markets and international relations.  Further extreme weather events due to climate change are almost certain, further straining resources and international relations.</p>
