    <p>From June 15-20, 2025, Israel and Iran exchanged intense missile strikes. Iranian missiles struck Israeli cities like Haifa and Beersheba, hitting a hospital and injuring over 200 people. Israel targeted Iran's nuclear sites, energy infrastructure, state TV, and claimed to kill Iran's wartime chief of staff. In Gaza, 38 Palestinians died in aid shootings, with 144 fatalities occurring in one 24-hour period.<br><br>President Trump urged Tehran residents to evacuate, demanded Iran's "unconditional surrender," and considered US strikes, setting a two-week diplomatic window. Russia continued deadly drone and missile attacks in Ukraine, killing at least 14 in Kyiv. The US Federal Reserve kept interest rates steady. China expanded its nuclear arsenal by 100 warheads and faced ongoing trade tensions. AI safety concerns also grew, with New York passing the RAISE Act and warnings of bioweapon risks and job displacement.<br><br>The near future will likely see intense diplomatic efforts to de-escalate the Israel-Iran conflict within Trump's two-week window. Direct US military intervention remains possible, risking regional war and global economic instability. Less likely, Iran could accelerate its nuclear program, with Russia warning of nuclear catastrophe, escalating global tensions.</p>
