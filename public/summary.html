    <p>During the period from July 22nd to July 29th, 2025, global events were dominated by several key issues.  In Israel, the Knesset approved Israeli sovereignty in the West Bank, sparking international concern.  Simultaneously,  Israel faced a car-ramming attack injuring eight soldiers, and escalating violence from Israeli settlers.  An Iran-Israel war was ongoing, with an activated Israeli Emergency Support Fund assisting victims.  Talks between Israel and Syria aimed to end Israeli attacks.  The Israeli Parliament also voted to officially make Apartheid policy.  <br><br>In Iran, mysterious explosions and fires occurred, with Iran suspecting Israeli involvement.  Iran also faced a severe water crisis,  a courthouse attack killing at least five, and the mass expulsion of Afghans following claims of Israeli spying.  New talks began regarding Iran's nuclear program, though expectations for a breakthrough were low.  Executions of members of a banned group also took place.<br><br>Meanwhile, Donald Trump's presidency was marked by controversies surrounding his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein,  trade negotiations with the EU and Japan resulting in 15% tariffs, a visit to Scotland, and  a proposed rebate check plan for Americans.  His approval ratings sank amid the Epstein scandal.  Trump also threatened military action against Iran and renewed sanctions threats on Russia.<br><br>The Ukraine war continued, with Russia conducting major naval drills and facing increasing economic woes.  Ukraine experienced pro-democracy protests in response to a controversial anti-corruption bill, which President Zelenskyy later reversed.  A new, faster way to arm Ukraine was developed.  The fighting around Pokrovsk intensified, and  $330 million more in military aid was approved for Ukraine from the US.  Additionally, Russia suffered from internal corruption and decreasing willingness to fight from its soldiers.  <br><br><br>The AI safety debate intensified, with concerns about hidden AI behaviors, self-harm guidance from ChatGPT, and the development of new safety regulations and initiatives by various countries and organizations.  A $15 million fund was raised to insure AI agents.  Sam Altman warned of job losses and national security threats posed by AI.<br><br>Financial markets saw rallies following Trump's tariff deals, though concerns remained about a potential year-end bear market and the concentration of US stocks.

The ICJ ruled that countries can sue each other over greenhouse gas emissions.  Significant advancements were made in cancer research and treatment, and numerous breakthroughs occurred across various scientific fields, including fusion power, quantum computing, and asteroid detection.<br><br><br>Likely near-future events include continued escalation of the Israel-Iran conflict and further deterioration of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.  Less likely but possible scenarios include a major breakthrough in the Iran nuclear talks, or a significant escalation of the war in Ukraine leading to direct confrontation between Russia and NATO.  These scenarios could significantly impact global markets and geopolitical stability, potentially causing wider conflicts and economic disruption.</p>
