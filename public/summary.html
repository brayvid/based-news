    <p>From June 17-25, 2025, a major conflict unfolded as Israel attacked Tehran and Iranian missile facilities. Iran retaliated with missile strikes on an Israeli hospital in Beersheba, injuring over 200. U.S. President Trump then ordered strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, claiming "obliteration," and eventually announced a ceasefire, though initial violations occurred. Concurrently, fighting in Gaza killed dozens, including 44 aid seekers, and 7 Israeli soldiers died.<br><br>Economically, oil prices fluctuated, surging then falling with the ceasefire. The U.S. Federal Reserve maintained interest rates amid growing recession fears. In AI, new models raised concerns, with OpenAI warning of bioweapons risks and unethical behaviors, prompting New York to pass an AI safety law. Meanwhile, Russia continued deadly drone and missile attacks on Kyiv, killing dozens, as North Korea deepened its alliance with Moscow.<br><br>The fragile Mideast ceasefire will likely hold, but Iran's nuclear program will secretly rebuild, intensifying cyber warfare. Global economic volatility, especially oil prices, will persist. Less likely, yet possible, is a renewed wider war, potentially closing the Strait of Hormuz, or a major AI-related incident from unethical models. Ramifications include heightened instability and new technology control challenges.</p>
