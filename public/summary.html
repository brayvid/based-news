    <p>During July and August 2025, significant global events unfolded.  The Israeli parliament voted to officially codify apartheid, prompting international condemnation, including a Slovenian arms embargo and Canada's planned recognition of a Palestinian state.  Simultaneously, Israel and Syria engaged in talks to de-escalate conflict.  In Iran, a severe water crisis worsened, alongside political violence, executions, and mass expulsion of Afghans. The US imposed new sanctions on Iran, accusing it of assassination plots.  <br><br>President Donald Trump's actions dominated headlines, including a trade deal with the EU imposing 15% tariffs, a new global tariff schedule effective August 7th,  and threats against Iran and Russia.  Trump also faced continued scrutiny regarding Jeffrey Epstein and a potential pardon for Ghislaine Maxwell.  His administration oversaw a 3% US economic rebound in Q2, but July's job growth was far below expectations at 73,000 jobs.  <br><br>Russia's war in Ukraine continued, with intense fighting and significant Russian attacks, including a deadly strike on Kyiv on July 31st, killing at least 15. Russia also faced internal issues, including corruption scandals and low ammunition supplies.  Concerns over AI safety grew,  with reports of concerning AI behavior, prompting government regulation and international cooperation initiatives.  A massive 8.7 magnitude earthquake off Russia's Kamchatka peninsula triggered tsunami warnings across the Pacific.<br><br>In the near future, expect escalating tensions in the Middle East, potentially leading to further conflict or a fragile peace agreement.  Increased international pressure on Israel and further economic fallout from Trumpâ€™s tariffs are highly likely.  Less likely but possible is a major escalation between the US and Iran or Russia.  The ramifications of these events could include widespread economic instability, refugee crises, and a further deterioration of international relations.</p>
