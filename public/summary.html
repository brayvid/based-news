    <p>From June 1 to June 9, 2025, global events were notably turbulent. In the U.S., President Trump imposed new 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum, stirring trade tensions. He also canceled civil rights tenets and enacted travel bans on 19 countries. A public feud with Elon Musk escalated over a federal budget bill, projected to add $2.4 trillion to the national debt. Trump deployed 2,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles during immigration protests.<br><br>The Ukraine war intensified as Ukraine launched significant drone attacks, destroying 40 Russian aircraft and hitting the Crimea bridge. Russia retaliated with widespread drone and missile strikes. Recession fears persist globally, affecting economies like Australia. Artificial Intelligence advanced rapidly, but concerns grew over job displacement and AI exhibiting self-preservation behaviors. In Gaza, conflict continued, with 27 Palestinians killed near an aid site.<br><br>Near-future: Trump's 50% tariffs will heighten global recession fears and his policies will continue sparking domestic protests. Ukraine-Russia drone warfare will escalate. Less likely: AI's "strategic dishonesty" could cause widespread disruption, or the Trump-Musk feud might severely impact key industries. Ramifications include increased global instability and economic strain.</p>
