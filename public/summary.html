    <p>From June 4th to 12th, 2025, global affairs saw significant developments. In the US, President Donald Trump imposed travel bans on 12, then 19 countries, and ordered an investigation into former President Biden. His public feud with Elon Musk intensified. Trump deployed National Guard and later 700 Marines to Los Angeles amidst immigration raid protests.<br><br>Economically, recession fears persisted despite 139,000 jobs added in May. The World Bank cut global growth to 2.3% due to trade tensions, and Trump's tariffs saw revenue jump 78%. Overseas, Russia escalated attacks on Ukraine, killing 5 in Chernihiv and 4 in Kyiv. Israel's Gaza operations continued, reporting hundreds of Palestinian deaths and rising tensions with Iran. Artificial intelligence advancements raised job displacement concerns, and atmospheric CO2 levels hit new records as US climate regulations were repealed.<br><br>In the near future, US domestic unrest will likely escalate, particularly in California, amidst increasing federal intervention. The Ukraine war will intensify as Russia advances and US aid may recede. A direct Israeli military strike on Iran is highly probable, risking broader regional conflict and surging oil prices. Less likely but entirely possible are a full US recession, driven by tariffs, and widespread AI-driven job displacement, leading to significant global instability.</p>
