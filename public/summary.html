Awdah Hathaleen, a Palestinian, was fatally shot by an Israeli settler, an event captured on video.

Meanwhile, Iran arrested 20 alleged Israeli spies and threatened to retaliate against an alleged Israeli attack on Evin Prison.  Tensions also rose between Iran and Russia over drone production.<br><br>In the US, Donald Trump's actions dominated the headlines. He announced a summit with Vladimir Putin in Alaska, potentially involving a land swap, and took unprecedented steps to exert control over Washington, D.C., including threatening homeless people and moving presidential portraits.  He also issued controversial executive orders impacting the economy,  retirement funds, and foreign aid, resulting in legal challenges.  Trump’s actions regarding Russia, including a planned summit,  drew criticism, with over half of Americans expressing distrust in his handling of the Ukraine war.  Globally, concerns grew over AI safety following the rapid jailbreaking of GPT-5, highlighting security vulnerabilities.

Trump’s actions will likely lead to more legal challenges and potentially wider political unrest.  The AI safety concerns will escalate, prompting stricter regulations.

The ramifications could involve mass displacement, economic collapse, and a drastic increase in international tensions.  Trump’s potential land swap with Russia could dramatically reshape geopolitical boundaries and have devastating effects on the international order.</p>
