Separately, New York State passed the RAISE Act, establishing AI safety safeguards to prevent \"catastrophic risks.\"<br><br>Likely, Israel and Iran will continue fighting for weeks, but a \"battered\" Iran will seek negotiations. Less likely, a full regional war could erupt if diplomacy fails or Iran withdraws from its nuclear treaty, risking instability and energy volatility. US President Trump will likely focus on domestic policies and tariffs."

    "summary": "Between June 15-17, 2025, global instability intensified. Israel and Iran are trading attacks for a fourth day, with Israeli strikes targeting Iran's nuclear sites and energy infrastructure. Iran retaliated, killing 8 people with missiles in Tel Aviv and Haifa. Israel also killed 38 Palestinians near Gaza aid sites. U.S. President Trump urged Tehran residents to evacuate and deployed defensive forces. Meanwhile, Russia launched deadly drone and missile attacks on Kyiv, killing at least 14, while Ukraine struck a Russian drone factory. Economically, oil prices rose, and U.S. retail sales declined. AI safety legislation advanced, with New York passing the RAISE Act.<br><br>The Israel-Iran conflict will likely persist, potentially escalating further, impacting global oil prices. Trump will push for a \"bigger\" resolution to Iran's nuclear program, possibly drawing the US in. Less likely but possible, Iran could exit the nuclear treaty, risking wider war and severe economic ramifications, with AI nuclear warnings adding global instability."
