Major military actions and escalating tensions between major world powers almost always cause such upheaval. The prediction about accelerating AI's dual-use dilemma is vague and lacks specific mechanisms or measurable outcomes. It doesn't predict a specific development beyond the already existing concerns mentioned in the context."
